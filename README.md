Welcome to Hosts Editor Project [Ubuntu distributions]
====================================================================================
A Symfony 3 application, built in purpose of learning some of the new exciting 
technologies that were launched in last couple of months.

Some of the main exciting technologies used in this project are:
- Symfony 3
- ReactJS
- Sass
- Flexbox
and so on.

This file will be continuously updated, as things evolve in the project and I find 
new and interesting stuff to add inside this README.md file.

Enjoy! and do not forget to send me your recommendation if you have any while keeping 
in mind that this is a WIP and the project might have suffered changes on my local 
machine before you get to see this info.

And now, Let's ROCK!
